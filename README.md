# Lottery Number Generator

A minimal lottery number generator built with Razor Pages in .NET

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Generates 6 **unique** random numbers between **1 and 49**
- Sorts the numbers in ascending order
- Assigns a background color based on number range:
  - 1â€“9: Grey
  - 10â€“19: Blue
  - 20â€“29: Pink
  - 30â€“39: Green
  - 40â€“49: Yellow
- Generates a **bonus ball** that is not part of the main numbers
- Simple web UI with minimal styling
- Core logic tested with **xUnit**

## ðŸ§  Design Notes

- Logic is abstracted into a service class (`LotteryNumberGenerator`) for testability and separation of concerns
- Used `HashSet` for uniqueness and `List.Sort()` for ordering
- Background color logic handled via a helper method
- Set up manually without Razor scaffolding to show deeper understanding

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
dotnet run --project LotteryApp
